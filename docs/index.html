        <p>The &ldquo;2019 update that isn&rsquo;t really an update&rdquo; edition.</p>
        <p>While attempts have been made to make a UserCSS version of <span class="code">ss16</span>, due to full-time employment, this userstyle has&rsquo;t seen the updates I would like.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/saxamaphone69/ss16/tree/20XX">20XX branch</a> does have some changes, mainly to adapt to the new 4chan/4channel domain split. But after the whole ISPs-banning-4chan and needing a VPN in my country, I&rsquo;ve slowly drifted away from it all.</p>
        <p>If I find the time, I will try to get a <span class="code">v2.1.0</span> released.</p>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p><span class="code">v2.0.0</span> a.k.a. <span class="code">ss18</span> has now been released.</p>
        <p>Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your view), <span class="code">ss16</span>, remains much the same after 2 years. A conflict with CCleaner and Stylus meant that <span class="code">ss18</span> had to be completely rewritten. But, this lead itself to some small improvements.</p>
        <p>Since <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stylus</a> is now the preferred userstyle manager, we can make use of UserCSS, so <span class="code">ss16</span> can now be auto-updated. One caveat is it does not allow the use of <span class="code">@import</span>, so for font loading to work, users must also install the complimentary font userstyle.</p>
        <p>Some changes include:</p>
        <ul class="change-list">
          <li>Better Custom Property naming, meaning variables make more sense.</li>
          <li>The catalogue now makes use of <span class="code">display:grid</span> as opposed to Masonry. Good in one way, bad in another.</li>
          <li><span class="code">sidedish</span> uses <span class="code">ES6</span> to try and be different.</li>
          <li>Board banners are supported via, again, an additional userstyle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/saxamaphone69/ss16/issues">Future versions</a> should hopefully include:</p>
        <ul class="change-list">
          <li>OneeChan support, meaning your favourite anime &ldquo;girl&rdquo; can follow you as you browse.</li>
          <li>Complete 4chan X support (all settings).</li>
          <li>Catalogue support (expand on hover).</li>
          <li><span class="code">sidedish</span> is just better overall.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is still suggested you <a href="https://github.com/saxamaphone69/ss16">read the install instructions</a> found in the README on the GitHub repo, as it outlines AdBlock/uBlock Origin filters and what is needed/required for <span class="code">ss16</span> to function correctly.</p>

        <h3 id="overview" class="heading--section">Overview</h3>
        <p>Created by <b>saxamaphone</b> <span class="trip">!3.saxN0DHY</span>, who has been making userstyles for <a href="https://4chan.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">4chan</a> since 2009 with styles such as <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/23586/3-shades-of-4chan">3 Shades of 4chan</a> (which only exists as Midnight Caek in App/OneeChan now), <a href="https://github.com/saxamaphone69/curabitr">curabitr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/saxamaphone69/xl">xl</a>.</p>
        <p><span class="code">ss16</span> is a fresh attempt to make a userstyle that looks radically different from the typical App/OneeChan aesthetic of today, utilising modern web standards and bleeding edge CSS technologies.</p>
        <p>First conceived in December 2015, <span class="code">ss16</span> has remained more-or-less the same. Updates are few and far between, only really being updated when new 4chan or 4chan X features are implemented.</p>

        <h3 id="features" class="heading--section">Features</h3>
        <div class="feature--grid">
          <div class="feature--grid-lcol">
            <span class="feature--heading">Documented Code</span>
            <p>The unminified version of <span class="code">ss16</span> contains commented CSS, explaining what it does, and why it does it.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">CSS Custom Properties</span>
            <p>Variables come to CSS in the form of Custom Properties; <span class="code">ss16</span> gives you the option to choose not only a primary and secondary colour, but every other colour - only needing to change it once.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Sidedish of Rice</span>
            <p>Unlike normal userstyles, <span class="code">ss16</span> requires a companion userscript for additional rice and features, not found in 4chan X or App/OneeChan.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Fully Featured</span>
            <p>While it does enforce some defaults, the latest version of 4chan X will always be supported (and required).</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Filtered Fun</span>
            <p>Through the use of 4chan X&rsquo;s filtering feature, additional classes can be added to elements to further enhance <span class="code">ss16</span>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature--grid-rcol">
            <span class="feature--heading">Web Fonts</span>
            <p><span class="code">ss16</span> uses <span class="code">@import</span> to load fonts such as Arimo, no longer needing you to download and install fonts locally, or use a Flash loader.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Sensible Defaults</span>
            <p><span class="code">ss16</span> utilises code from well-established web projects such as Bootstrap, H5BP, Normalize, and the Material Design Guidelines to ensure elements render consistently and correctly across browsers.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">No <span class="code">!important;</span>s</span>
            <p>As it is meant to be a replacement CSS, <span class="code">ss16</span> requires users to block both 4chan&rsquo;s default CSS and 4chan X&rsquo;s (done with the userscript), resulting in cleaner code.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Material Icons</span>
            <p>All icons have been replaced from Font Awesome to Material Icons, and things that should be icons have been turned into them.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>It should be noted that <span class="code">ss16</span> <b class="underline">does not</b> function with either the default 4chan Extension or App/OneeChan. 4chan X must only be used.</p>
